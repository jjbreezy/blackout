                    <p>You move that number of spaces toward the planet opposite your starting planet.</p>

                        landed on a Wormhole &#9787.</p>
                    <p>You read your card aloud and follow the instructions on the card. Some cards apply to all players.</p>
                    <p>At the end of your turn, you pour a chosen amount of your drink into the Black Hole Cup.</p>
                    <p>If your pour overflows the Black Hole Cup, you finish it.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Spill: a confession of fact.</li>
                        <li>Dare: a dare to do an action.</li>
                        <li>Group: a question to the whole group.</li>
                        <li>Movement: how a player's piece will move.</li>
                        <li>Game: a game to be played with other players.</li>
                        <li>Rule: a new game rule, triggered by the action specified on the card. It helps to write
                            these down.</li>
                        <li>Blackout: An eyes-closed blind vote where players in the minority will drink</li>

                <div class="rulescontent">
                    <h3>Wormholes</h3>
                    <p>A Wormhole looks like this:</p>
                    <img src="/img/smiley_solo.png">
                    <p>The player who lands in a Wormhole &#9787 will finish the Black Hole Cup.</p>
                    <p>That player will then move one Wormhole &#9787 closer to their goal planet. A player from Planet Sigma will move closer to Planet Delta, and vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here is an example of how a player from Team Delta would move if they landed on a Wormhole.</p>
                    <img src="/img/wormhole_example.png">
                    <ol class="exampletext">
                        <li>Player rolls a 4.</li>
                        <li>Player lands on a Wormhole &#9787.</li>
                        <li>Player drinks the Black Hole Cup and then adds their pour after they finish.</li>
                        <li>Player exits the Wormhole &#9787 closer to their goal. Their next turn will begin on this Wormhole &#9787.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If no Wormholes &#9787 remain between the player and their goal planet, that player moves
                        directly to their goal planet.</p>
                    <p> Wormholes &#9787 may not be skipped. If a player lands on a wormhole and is unwilling or unable to finish the Black Hole Cup, they 
                        may ask their team for a volunteer to finish the cup for them.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="rulescontent">
                    <h3>Ending the Game</h3>
                    <p>Whichever team gets all of its players across the board to the opposite planet first wins.</p>
