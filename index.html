            <div class="modal-body">
                <p>2+ Players</p>
                <p>Ages 21 and up.</p>
                <p>Contains explicit content</p>
                <div class="rulescontent">
                    <h3>Gameplay Rules</h3>
                    <p>A player may choose to skip their turn if they draw a card they are not comfortable with for any
                        reason. A player who skips their turn will leave their piece unmoved.
                    </p>
                    <p>There is no limit to the number of skips a player may use, but one should keep in mind that
                        skipping your turn puts your crew at a significant disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>If any player vomits, the game is over immediately. The vomiting player's team forefits the game
                        for allowing their teammate to exceed their limits.</p>
                    <p>Every turn, the player will pour an amount of their drink into the Black Hole Cup.</p>
                    <p>The player whose pour causes the glass to spill will finish the Black Hole Cup. That player does
                        not move to the next wormhole.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="rulescontent">
                    <h3>Your Turn</h3>
                    <p>The player will roll the dice once at the start of their turn.</p>
                    <p>The player will move their piece the number of spaces displayed on the dice towards their goal planet.</p>
                    <p>Once their piece is finished moving, the player will draw a card from the deck unless they have
                        landed on a special space.</p>
                    <p>The player may choose to go left or right towards their goal planet when they are faced with a crossroads.

                    <h3>Cards</h3>
                    <p>There are many different kinds of cards in Blackout.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spill: a confession of fact.</li>
                        <li>Dare: a dare to do an action.</li>
                        <li>Group: a question to the whole group.</li>
                        <li>Movement: how a player's piece will move.</li>
                        <li>Game: a game to be played with other players.</li>
                        <li>Rule: a new game rule, triggered by the action specified on the card. It helps to write
                            these down.</li>
                        <li>Blackout: An eyes-closed blind vote where players in the minority will drink</li>
                    </ul>
                </div> -->
                <div class="rulescontent">
                    <h3>Wormhole</h3>
                    <p>A wormhole looks like this:</p>
                    <img src="/img/smiley_solo.png">
                    <p>A player who lands in a wormhole will drink the entirety of the black hole cup in the center of
                        the board.</p>
                    <p>That player will then move one wormhole closer to their goal planet. A player from Planet Sigma will move closer to Planet Delta, and vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <p>If no wormholes remain between the player and their goal planet, that player moves
                        directly to their goal planet.</p>
                    <p> Wormholes may not be skipped. If a player lands on a wormhole and is unwilling or unable to finish the black hole cup, they 
                        may ask their team for a volunteer to finish the cup in their place. That volunteer's piece will move to the next wormhole towards their
                        goal planet, and the person who landed on the wormhole will move back to the space they were in before the roll that 
                        landed them on the wormhole.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="rulescontent">
                    <h3>Starting the Game</h3>
                    <p>An empty cup should be placed on the black hole in the center of the board, to be filled by the players as the game progresses.</p>
                    <p>The players will divide into two teams (Team Delta Δ and Team Sigma Σ) before the game begins, and sit alternating teams around
                        the board.</p>
                    <p>Team Sigma will start with all their players on Planet Sigma, and Team Delta will start with all their players on Planet Delta.</p>
                    <p>The oldest player will play first, the turn order proceeds clockwise from them around the circle
                        of players.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="rulescontent">
                    <h3>Ending the Game</h3>
                    <p>The game ends when all players of a single team have crossed from their starting side of the
                        board to the planet on the opposite side of the board.</p>
                    <p>Whichever team gets all of its players across the board to the opposite planet first wins.</p>
                </div>
