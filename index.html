                <h2>RULES</h2> <!-- short version -->
                <p>2+ Players</p>
                <p>Ages 21 and up.</p>
                <p>Contains explicit content</p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Gameplay Rules</h3>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Every player must finish a full glass of water over the course of a single game. Any team who has
                        water remaining in any of their players' glasses will forefit.
                    </p>
                    <p>A player may choose to skip their turn if they draw a card they are not comfortable with for any reason.
                        A player who skips their turn will leave their piece unmoved. 
                    </p>
                    <p>There is no limit to the number of skips a player may use, but one should keep in mind that skipping your turn
                        puts your crew at a significant disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>If any player vomits, the game is over immediately. The vomiting player's team forefits the game for 
                        allowing their teammate to exceed their limits.</p>
                    <p>Every turn, the player will pour an amount of their drink into the Black Hole Cup.</p>
                    <p>The player whose pour causes the glass to spill will finish the Black Hole Cup. That player does not move to the next wormhole.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Your Turn</h3>
                    <p>Player will roll the dice once at the start of their turn (unless otherwise instructed by a card).</p>
                    <p>Player will move their piece the number of spaces displayed on the dice</p>
                    <p>Once their piece is finished moving, Player will draw a card from the deck unless they have landed on a special space</p>
                    <p>Player will choose to either act on the card they have drawn or to pass and forefit their turn.</p>
                    <p>If Player wishes to pass on a special space, player will return their piece to the space it was in before they moved.</p>
                    <p>Player may choose to go left or right towards their goal when they are faced with a crossroads.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Cards</h3>
                    <p>There are many different kinds of cards in Blackout.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spill: a confession of fact.</li>
                        <li>Dare: a dare to do an action.</li> 
                        <li>Group: a question to the whole group.</li> 
                        <li>Movement: how a player's piece will move.</li>
                        <li>Game: a game to be played with other players.</li> 
                        <li>Rule: a new game rule, triggered by the action specified on the card. It helps to write these down.</li>
                        <li>Blackout: An eyes-closed blind vote where players in the minority will drink</li>
                        <!--time bomb, a card that begins a countdown when flipped over-->
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Special Spaces</h3>
                    <p>There are special spaces that trigger certain actions when they are landed on by a player</p>
                    
                    <h4>Wormhole</h4>
                    <p>A player who lands in a wormhole will drink the entirety of the black hole cup in the center of the board.</p>
                    <p>That player will then move one wormhole closer to their goal side.</p>
                    <p>If no wormholes remain between the player and their goal landing point (side), that player moves directly to their landing point.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moonshot</h4>
                    <p></p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Starting the Game</h3>
                    <p>The players will divide into two teams before the game begins, and sit alternating teams around the board.</p>
                    <p>The oldest player will play first, the turn order proceeds clockwise from them around the circle of players.
                        players.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Ending the Game</h3>
                    <p>The game ends when all players of a single team have crossed from their starting side of the
                        board to the opposite side of the board.</p>
                    <p>Whichever team gets all of its players across the board to the opposite planet first wins.</p>
                    <p>There are several circumstances that can cause a team to forefit.</p>
                </div>
